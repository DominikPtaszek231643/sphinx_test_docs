**Defining the Problem Based on Market Research:**

Our market research highlighted a critical problem in university settings: the inefficiency in quickly identifying and booking accessible study rooms. This challenge impacts the productivity of students and staff, leading to wasted time and resources. The need for a solution that addresses this problem became evident through our analysis of industry trends and the increasing demand for efficient facility management systems.

**Main Stakeholder and Their Needs:**

Our main stakeholder is The Innovation Square, representing the university administration responsible for campus facilities and operations. Their needs include:

- Efficient space utilization to accommodate the growing student population.
- Optimized scheduling and allocation of study spaces to improve the overall campus experience.
- Data-driven insights for making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and space management.

**DAPS Diagram Overview:**

Our Data-Analytic Problem-Solving (DAPS) diagram outlines the key components of our application:

- Data-Analytic Problem: Detecting classroom occupancy from images using machine learning.
- Decision Framework: Utilizing occupancy data to optimize space management and scheduling.
- Business Value: Enhancing operational efficiency, improving student and faculty experiences, and supporting data-driven decision-making in facility management.

**Explanation of CODS - Classroom Occupancy Detection System:**

Our idea for an application, the Classroom Occupancy Detection System (CODS), leverages image classification algorithms to assess visual data from classroom contexts. CODS aims to:

- Process and analyze images of classrooms to determine real-time occupancy status (occupied or vacant).
- Provide binary classification outputs that aid in optimizing space management and scheduling.
- Support decision-making by The Innovation Square to allocate resources effectively and improve the overall campus experience.

CODS aligns with market demands, addresses stakeholder needs, and offers a practical solution to the identified problem of inefficient space utilization in educational institutions.
